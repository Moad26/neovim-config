# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration files, tailored for an efficient and customized coding experience.

## Features

- **Plugin Management**: Uses `lazy.nvim` for efficient plugin handling.
- **LSP Support**: Integrated Language Server Protocol for enhanced coding experience.
- **Autocomplete**: Powered by `nvim-cmp` for smooth code completion.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Leveraging `nvim-treesitter` for improved syntax highlighting.
- **File Navigation**: Features `nvim-tree.lua` for efficient file browsing.

For lint-format branch the config for formating and linting is more complexe by using comfort + nvim-lint instead of just null-ls
